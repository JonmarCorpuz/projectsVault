    interval 2                     # Run the script every 2 seconds
    weight 2                       # Increase VRRP instance priority by 2 if script is successful
}

# Definition of the HA VRRP instance
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER                   # Configure this as the master node
    interface eth0                 # Specify the network interface to bind VRRP to
